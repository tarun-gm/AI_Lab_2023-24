### DATE: 04.10.2025                                                                            
### REGISTER NUMBER : 212223060284
### AIM: 
To find the sequence of plan for Monkey Banana problem using PDDL Editor.
###  Algorithm:
Step 1:  Start the program <br> 
Step 2 : Create a domain for Monkey Banana Problem. <br> 
Step 3:  Create a domain by specifying predicates. <br> 
Step 4: Specify the actions GOTO, CLIMB, PUSH-BOX, GET-KNIFE, GRAB-BANANAS in Monkey Banana problem.<br>  
Step 5:   Define a problem for Monkey Banana problem.<br> 
Step 6:  Obtain the plan for given problem.<br> 
Step 7: Stop the program.<br> 
### Program:

  )

  (:action GET-KNIFE
    [cite_start]:parameters (?y) [cite: 112]
    [cite_start]:precondition (and (location ?y) (at knife ?y) (at monkey ?y)) [cite: 113]

    [cite_start]:effect (hasbananas) [cite: 119]
  )

  (:action PICKGLASS
    [cite_start]:parameters (?y) [cite: 122]

  )

  (:action GETWATER
    [cite_start]:parameters (?y) [cite: 126]
    [cite_start]:precondition (and (location ?y) (hasglass) (at waterfountain ?y) (at monkey ?y) (onbox ?y)) [cite: 127, 128, 129, 130]
    [cite_start]:effect (haswater) [cite: 131]
  )
)
```
### PROBLEM 1
```
(define (problem pb1)
  (:domain monkey) [cite_start][cite: 135]
  (:objects p1 p2 p3 p4 bananas monkey box knife) [cite_start][cite: 136]
  (:init 
    (location p1) [cite_start][cite: 137]
    (location p2) [cite_start][cite: 138]
    (location p3) [cite_start][cite: 139]
    (location p4) [cite_start][cite: 140]
    (at monkey p1) [cite_start][cite: 141]
    (on-floor) [cite_start][cite: 142]
    (at box p2) [cite_start][cite: 143]
    (at bananas p3) [cite_start][cite: 144]
    (at knife p4) [cite_start][cite: 145]
